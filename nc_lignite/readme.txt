---------------NodeCore Lignite---------------
----------------------------------------------
---------------By WintersKnight---------------
----------------------------------------------

A mod for NodeCore that adds lignite, and ore of coal.
Lignite deposits can be found by following the dark stains in the stone.
Lignite cobble can be pummeled with a pick or hammer, to reduce it to gravel and lumps of coal.


----------------------------------------------
--IF nc_dust is ALSO installed--
Mining and refining lignite can be hazardous, however;
Mining lignite and smashing/picking the coal from it produce coal dust, which cannot be picked up, can be seen/built through, can suffocate you, and is highly flammable.
Coal Dust dissapates on its own after a while, settling and blowing away.
